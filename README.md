# Abstract Data Types (ADTs)

This project explores core Abstract Data Types (ADTs) through custom Java implementations.

ADTs define *what* operations a data structure supports without specifying *how* they are implemented. This abstraction enables modular, efficient, and reusable software design.

Understanding ADTs is essential in computer scienceâ€”they form the basis of algorithm design, data organization, and system architecture.

This work reinforces key concepts in interface-driven development and prepares the foundation for studying more complex structures and algorithms.
